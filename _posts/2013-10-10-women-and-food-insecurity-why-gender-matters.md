Food security is the secure access to sufficient food (both in quality and in
quantity) and is considered a basic human right. Food insecurity is the lack of access to
these resources and can range from worrying about being able to buy nutritious foods, to
starvation. In the developing world, women and girls experience more hunger than men,
globally more than 60 percent of those who are food insecure are female. Reasons for this
phenomenon include patriarchal systems and gender disparities that prevent women from
owning land and securing resources. During the 2011 food crisis in the Horn of Africa
close to 1 million people fled Somalia for refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia – the
majority of these were women and girls.

The World Food Program believes women may be the key to combating food
security worldwide food insecurity now and in future generations -women prepare
meals for their families and are traditionally the caregivers. In developing countries they
produce up to 80% of the food, run most of the small farms, and are involved in livestock
and fishing. They are an important gateway to feeding their families and communities,
however discrimination and other obstacles (e.g., lack of resources, training, and
technology) often prevent them from accessing the resources needed to provide food
for themselves, their families, and their community. Women are crucial to combatting
childhood food insecurity, by providing food to women, food is provided to children and
families. Maternal health is vital; ensuring sufficient food prenatally and during the first
two years of life is essential to lifelong health. Malnourished mothers are not only more
likely to die in childbirth; their children are 20% less likely to survive to age five.

Unfortunately, in addition to experiencing more food insecurity than men women
also suffer more from food insecurity than men do in terms of physical health and mental
health and well-being, they are also much less like to survive a famine or natural disaster.
Women who are food insecure are more likely to suffer from stress, anxiety, and
depression. The stress of living in poverty, being food insecure, and being responsible for
feedings one’s children can cause women to engage in risky behaviors and coping
strategies. This can include abnormal ways of acquiring food such as trading food for sex
or staying in that are violent or abusive in order to ensure there is food for themselves
and their children. Therefore it is not surprising that in sub-Saharan Africa food
insecurity is linked to sexual risk and higher rates of HIV.

In the report “Gender Equality and Food Security: Women’s Empowerment as a
Tool Against Hunger” Olivier De Schutter - the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on
the Right to Food wrote “Gender equality can make a substantial contribution to a
country’s economic growth, and it is the single most important determinant of food
security”. He argues that women and girls limited access to education and employment
weakens their bargaining position within the family and results in women and girls
having less access to food and subsequently health. The discrimination they face not
only weakens their access to food, it makes it harder for them to participate in food
production, processing, and marketing. This means when there are high levels of gender
discrimination food insecurity increases for the whole community. In order for these
patterns to change social and cultural gender norms must be challenged and women must
be empowered.

Choosing to focus on Millennial Development Goal number 3, to promote gender
equality and empower women could be essential for tackling the rest of the Millennial
Development Goals such as eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, improving maternal
health, and reducing child mortality. Women and girls are vital for improving health and
targeting global poverty. We need to advocate for gender equality in order to achieve
food security and eradicate poverty.
